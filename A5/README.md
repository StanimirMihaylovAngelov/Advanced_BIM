# Project reflections 
## Our learning experience
We started with a very basic understanding of the file format IFC, but not in relation to IfcOpenShell. By following this course, we have gotten a broader general understanding of IfcOpenShell, as well as a deeper understanding of the IFC format and the interconnection of disciplines and parameters within them, required for executing a task or a script. We can see the large potential that this software has, but we are not able to implement it ourselves at that level.  

Some of our group members had never used Python before this course, therefore it was hard work at the start to understand the codes, and even harder to generate our own script, and make it do what we wanted it to do. However, we managed to learn some Python coding and ended up creating something great.
We feel like we still need to learn more fundamental concepts, and basic principles of programming, increase our personal libraries with codes, and program more. 

In the future, we might use OpenBIM to extract and manipulate data from different file sources, improve model data quality and even improve model performance.
