# Project reflections 
## Our learning experience
We started with a very basic understanding of the file format IFC, but not in relation to IfcOpenShell. By following this course, we have gotten a broader general understanding of IfcOpenShell, as well as a deeper understanding of the IFC format and the interconnection of disciplines and parameters within them, required for executing a task or a script. We can see the large potential that this software has, but we are not able to implement it ourselves at that level.  

Some of our group members had never used Python before this course, therefore it was hard work at the start to understand the codes, and even harder to generate our own script, and make it do what we wanted it to do. However, we managed to learn some Python coding and ended up creating something great.
We feel like we still need to learn more fundamental concepts, and basic principles of programming, increase our personal libraries with codes, and program more. 

In the future, we might use OpenBIM to extract and manipulate data from different file sources, improve model data quality and even improve model performance. 

## Our developing process
We would not prefer fewer choices regarding the use cases, but maybe more instructions and clearer expectations. More examples are always better.

It would have been better to have fewer tools to choose from, due to the level of group work complications and feedback issues. Our group chose to use BIMvision instead of BlenderBIM since this tool made it easier to understand the propertysets, visualise data, visualise the model (split building in stories and isolate specific elements) etc.

## Our received feedback
Based on the feedback the use case gave a good introduction to how BIMvision, Ifcopenshell and Python all interact with one another. Also, the case was well modelled. However, more comments in the script could have been nice. Especially with regard to choosing the correct directory, downloading the model to the correct folder and general comments. 

Based on the feedback the use case was well-scoped, by having the necessary installation guides before the tutorial, so that the user (modeller, level 1) would know what to install before starting to follow the tutorial.

## Our future of OpenBIM
The likelihood of us using OpenBIM in our thesis is difficult to say at this point. We are leaning towards not writing a thesis on OpenBIM, but should the opportunity occur, we may reconsider our decision based on the potential benefits it could bring to the project. Furthermore with the access to Opensource software only increasing, we do not see why OpenBIM should not be used more and more, both in our professional lives and upcoming thesis (maybe).
