# BIM Execution Plan

**Use case:** The chosen use case is a daylight analysis consisting of a daylight autonomy. The script should: read certain information from the IFC model; import external information from other files and formats; combine the two, and compare the results to regulations, requirements, and goals; edit object properties in order to meet the regulations, requirements, and goals. However, due to limited time and programming skills, the focus of this assignment is on the preparation of the IFC-model, or rather the addition of surface reflectance in case of missing data.  


**Users:** This case can be used by the designers, architects, and daylight engineers in the early stages of the project.
